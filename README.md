# webviewTemplate

A template for generating webviews in React Native. This essentially replaces the need for iframes and allows one to launch a browser natively within the mobile application instead of launching a browser like safari in a seperate window.

TO START:
 1). Clone repo
 2). Download Xcode or Exponent
 3). launch iOS simulator
 4). be amazed at your new webView!
 5). feel free to play around witht the url, it should be able to access any valid domain name
